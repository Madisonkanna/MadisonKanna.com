"12 Rules For Life" by Jordan B. Peterson was one of the best books I've read in a long time. I was luckily able to attend Peterson's 12 rules for life book tour and got to briefly [meet him!](https://www.instagram.com/p/B5tPUnkAxQv/)

## Rule 1

Stand up straight with your shoulders back.

## Rule 2

Treat yourself like you would someone you are responsible for helping.

## Rule 3
Make friends with people who want the best for you.

## Rule 4 
Compare yourself with who you were yesterday, not with who someone else is today.

## Rule 5 
Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them.

## Rule 6 
Set your house in perfect order before you criticise the world.

## Rule 7
 Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient.)

## Rule 8 
Tell the truth â€“ or, at least, donâ€™t lie.

## Rule 9 
Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you donâ€™t.

## Rule 10 
Be precise in your speech.

## Rule 11
 Do not bother children when they are skate-boarding.

## Rule 12
Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street.
