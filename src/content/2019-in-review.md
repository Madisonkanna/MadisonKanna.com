A photo of me visiting the Art Institute in Chicago this summer.

I wrote down a few of the things I accomplished this year and a few things I could have done better. 

## What I did

I got more serious about my fitness and health this year than I ever have before. In April or May I decided to make working out a priority and stick with it. Instead of doing pilates maybe twice a week like I did for years, I learned from an expert and started a weight training program customized for me. I started faithfully hitting the gym 3 or 4 times a week. Lifting weights has made me feel strong and I love the changes I see in my body. I've always been quite thin but now I actually feel muscular and I gained about five pounds. I'll continue my fitness routine going into 2020 and ideally gain 5-10 more pounds, which would put me at a more healthy weight. 

I was lucky enough to attend several Egghead workshops this year as an Egghead [Learner Advocate](https://www.notion.so/Learner-Advocate-Workshop-Participation-96698490b506495dad7d932ebc9b055f#990b19a568914329ac038f922b42cc42). With instructors teaching live and answering questions in the moment, I was able to learn so much more efficiently during these workshops than I likely would have on my own. 

I was able to attend [Bradfield](https://bradfieldcs.com/). Bradfield teaches computer science to professional developers with classes that usually include hands-on exercises and discussions. I learned so much more computer science fundamentals than I could have just learning on my own. I got to learn from a smart and passionate teacher and I got to learn with other curious software engineers. After growing up homeschooled and leaving college, I never realized how amazing learning in a classroom can be. Bradfield was very challenging for me but not too overwhelming. I hope to take at least two more classes there in 2020. 

I left a job and a serious relationship. Not sure if I would call these accomplishments at all, but sometimes you know when something isn't going anywhere and you have to make a painful decision. I also went from working remotely and visting Pennsylvania as much as I could to planting myself back in California, and I've felt so much happier now that I'm not trying to live in two states at once.

## What I could have done better

I wasn't consistent enough in different areas of my life this year. With this blog, I was very inconsistent with posting. I started building different projects and abandoned them before completion. I also spent a fair amount of the year feeling stuck in a situation and I could've worked more on figuring out how to change it rather than feeling resigned to it.

### 2020

Going into 2020, here are some of the things I want to focus on:

Continue to advance my JavaScript and React skills at my job and through my weekend projects. I'm excited to learn from the awesome developers I work with.

Continue to write daily and blog twice per month about JavaScript or anything else that interests me. 

Keep reading about cryptography and gain a deeper understanding of it. 

Start my coding book club and continue my book club with my dad.

Release my course again--more on that later. 

Continue working on my fitness and health goals, as well as my cooking goals.

Go on some sort of adventure every month. I feel like I spent so many weekends in 2019 just working in my room and turning down fun opportunities. My close friends [Amanda and Ryan](https://www.theworldwanderers.com/) are a good example of people who work hard but also take the time to experience life. They are always exploring somewhere new or trying something new. I want to spend more time doing this in 2020.

Happy 2020!
