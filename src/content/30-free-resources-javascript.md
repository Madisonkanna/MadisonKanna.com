If you’re learning JavaScript, you’ve most likely heard how important it is to learn the fundamentals. 

---


Problem is, you aren’t sure what the fundamentals are. And, with thousands of resources on the Internet, where do you begin? 

In an episode of [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/show/162/the-fundamentals-js), Wes and Scott do a great job of covering JavaScript fundamentals. They go over the core JS skills that I use each day at my job as a JavaScript developer. While listening to the episode, I thought how helpful it would’ve been for me, as a beginner, to have a curated list of resources for learning each fundamental concept—so I created it for you.

Below are the JavaScript fundamentals Wes and Scott listed, along with my favorite (and 100% free) resources for learning each one.

As Wes and Scott point out, building real projects with JavaScript is what will cement these fundamentals you’ve read about. Make sure to build projects as you go! If you feel stuck on how to go from tutorials to actually building projects, check out  [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-go-from-coding-tutorials-to-building-your-own-projects-b9ab51074980/)  I wrote. 

While there are many incredible resources on the internet, I purposefully kept this list short. If you have more great resources or feel something was left out, feel free to leave a comment below and share.
