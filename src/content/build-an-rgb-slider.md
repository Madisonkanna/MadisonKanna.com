##  What will we build?

RGB slier. 

```jsx

const hi = (a, b) = {
    console.log(a)
}

const woo
```

We'll learn about how colors are used on the internet and an intro to RGB, hex, etc. 
Then we'll build an RGB slider.

Here we're building something that is relatively simple--an RGB slider that will show you the RGB and hex.

We'll also go over building browser-compatible inputs, and talk about testsfor this project.
The goal of this is to learn about a few core things here:
-Adding unit tests to your project.
-Colors on the internet.
-Browser cross-comptability, its importance.
