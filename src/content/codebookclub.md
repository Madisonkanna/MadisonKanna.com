Here you'll find details about the CodeBookClub. Who are we?

We are hundreds of developers of all experience levels learning together. We hold live online meetups on Zoom, a video conference software. We pair program, hold group coding sessions, and read/discuss tutorials, courses and technical books together. Take a look at this quick [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCLnBkHeUJQ&t=82s) I  made about the club.
