Here you'll find details about the CodeBookClub. Who are we?

We are hundreds of developers of all experience levels learning together. We hold live online meetups on Zoom, a free video conference software. We pair program, hold group coding sessions to prepare for technical interviews, and read/discuss tutorials, courses and technical books together. Take a look at this quick [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCLnBkHeUJQ&t=82s) I  made about the club.

If you'd like to join for the first time or find details on a particular meeting:

1. **Join** our [email list](https://madisonkanna.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=323fd92759e9e0b8d4083d008&id=033dfeb98f) to get your invitation to the club by email, and to get updates on future books or community events. 
2. **Read** the #welcome channel before posting, and make sure you post in the relevant channel. If the link is not working for whatever reason, email me and let me know or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Madisonkanna) where I'll be posting new links.
3. **Introduce yourself** in the discord.
4. **Remember** that you don't need to attend every meeting or event in the club! Just make it when you can. 

# Live Meetings.

Every Sunday, the CodeBookClub has a live event. This is either a discussion group about the book we're currently reading, or it is a live CodeWars group coding challenge. 

We have a public calender for the club [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=c292Ymk1dnU5bzRuanE5ZG5kYjNpbG84NDRAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) so you can get the exact Zoom link you'll need to join and a notification on your calender before the event starts. 

# CodeWars Group Coding Sessions.

Every other Sunday, we have a group coding session. 

**What:** We hold group coding sessions, where we tackle CodeWars problems together. This is a great way to practice coding, communication, and other skills that will help you when you do technical interviews.

***When:*** Starts at 2:00PM PST/5PM EST and ends one hour later.

**Where:** On Zoom at this same link each week: https://zoom.us/j/844450872


# You Don't Know JS Discussion Group.

**What**: You Don't Know JS book club. 

**When**: 2pm PST/5pm EST on Sundays.

**Currently Reading:** Scope & Closures, Book 2 in the series.

You can learn more about the You Don't Know JS series [here](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS).

Feel free to join the weekly reading at any time. You don't have to come to every meeting, and we'll go over discussion questions to cement what we learned, and help each other get clarity on whatever concepts or ideas we are still confused on or struggling with.
Kyle Simpson himself recently joined our live call for a Q&A session!

**Where:** On Zoom at this same link each week. The Zoom link will be given to you once you join the discord.

# Intro To Computing reading.

We are currently reading Intro To Computing, an introduction to computer science textbook.

You can learn more about our reading [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SbvZsedIS8-Vguue5HquIs6tobwnrF5uRaXTrOLwwCE/edit?usp=sharing).


Again, we have a public calender for the club [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=c292Ymk1dnU5bzRuanE5ZG5kYjNpbG84NDRAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) so you can get the exact Zoom link you'll need to join the live meeting, and a notification on your calender about the event before every single event starts. If you don't want to join or discord or are currently unable to, add yourself to the calender above to get notified when every event happens.
