## You can change, but you choose not to. <a name="one"></a>
Etiology is the study of causation. Take the example of a person who is afraid to go outside. This person believes that because of past events in his life, he now feels fear and anxiety about going out. 

Teleology is the study of the purpose of a given phenomenon, rather than its causes. In Adlerian psychology, you think not about past causes but present goals. 

Teleology would say that the person who is afraid of going outside has the present goal of not going outside. To achieve this goal, he creates symptoms such as fear and anxiety. Adler is not saying that this person’s past events did not have a huge influence, but that nothing has been determined by these influences.

 We determine our own lives according to the meaning we give to the past
 
The problem with etiology is that you can't move forward. If you believe your future and present are determined, you won't change them, because you’ll believe that you can’t.  

Adlerian psychology is the psychology of courage. When we choose to change our lives, our courage is put to the test. We’re scared of trying to change, and what could happen if we do, so we feel it is easier and more secure to leave things the way they are. In other words, our unhappiness is not caused by our past or our environment. We’re unhappy because we lack the courage to be.

## All problems are interpersonal relationship problems. <a name="two"></a>

If all interpersonal relationships were gone from the world, there would be no problems. Every problem comes down to an interpersonal relationship problem. For example, say that you dislike yourself and only focus on your shortcomings. At first, this might not seem as if it relates to any interpersonal relationships problems. 

But why do you dislike yourself? Why are you focused on your shortcomings?

Because you’re afraid of being hurt by other people. You have the goal of not getting hurt in relationships with other people. To achieve this goal, you start to dislike yourself.  You become someone who doesn’t enter into interpersonal relationships. Then you have a justification ready when people snub you or when you shy away from relationships.  Stating “This is just the way I am” actually benefits you. 

You’ve avoided interpersonal relationships by disliking yourself. 

When we compare ourselves to others, we create subjective feelings of inferiority.
