# Introduction and Doctrinal Background. <a name="one"></a>


Under any economic, social, or political system, individuals, business firms, and organizations in general are subject to lapses from efficient, rational, law-abiding, virtuous or otherwise functional behavior. Each society learns to live with a certain amount of such dysfunctional or misbehavior, but if it leads to general decay, society must be able to marshal from within itself forces which will make as many of the faltering actors as possible revert to the behavior required for its proper functioning.

Economists have paid little attention to repairable lapses of economic actors. 2 reasons for this neglect: 
1. Economists assume rational behavior or unchangeable amounts of rationality on the part of the economic actors. They assume that a business firm falls behind “for a good reason.”
2. In the traditional model of the competitive economy, recovery from any lapse is not essential. As one firm loses out in the competitive struggle, its market share is taken up by another. 

Economists believe the economy is a fully competitive system where changes in the fortunes of individual firms are exclusively caused by shifts of comparative advantages. This picture does not take into account monopolistic competition, monopoly, or deterioration in performance of firms operating in that part of the economy that could result in permanent pockets of inefficiency. 

Declines in fortunes of individual firms are just as likely to be due to random factors that are reversible as to permanent adverse shifts in cost and demand conditions. In these circumstances, mechanisms of recuperation would be useful. Some may argue that competition is a mechanism of recuperation. Yet:
1.  The implications of this particular function of competition have not been adequately spelled out.
2. a major alternative mechanism can come into play either when the competitive mechanism is unavailable or as a complement to it.
