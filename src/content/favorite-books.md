### An ongoing list of books I love and would read again. Slowly adding my biggest takeaways from these books in the sections below.
### The Worldly Philosophers
### The Art Of The Start
### [The Revolt Of The Public By Martin Guri.](https://www.madisonkanna.com/posts/revolt-of-the-public/)
What happened to journalism and the media? How did Trump get elected?
### Sophie's World: A Novel About the History of Philosophy by Jostein Gaarder. 
### Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen
### Persausion by Jane Austen
### Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen.
### Mansfield Park by Jane Austen
### Emma by Jane Austen
### Deep Work by Cal Newport.
My biggest takeaway from this book is that focus is a muscle that must be strengthened with practice. I've taken the rules from this book and modified and tweaked them in the last few years to work well for me. Back in 2017 I gave a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ek5nxE2sC6U) on this book after the second time I read it.
### To Kill A Mocking Bird
### Meditations
### Amusing ourselves to death by Neil Postman.
### Introduction to computing by David Evans.
I first read this a few years ago when I wanted to start dipping my toes into learning computer science. This is a fantastic book that is perfect for self-taught developers who want to learn CS. The author of this book, David Evans, gives this book out 100% free [online.](https://computingbook.org/)
### Redwall series
### Can’t hurt me by David Goggins
A lot of people said this is the only "self-help" book you will ever need. Others also said that if reading this book doesn't cause you to change your life, no book will. Agree.
### I Will Teach You To Be Rich by Ramit Sethi. 
A book about getting your finances in order. Goes over the fundamentals of investing, spending, saving and how to live a rich life, which really means spending on things you care about and living a good life. A good read when you're in your 20s and you're setting up your 401k, Roth IRA, etc. I wish I had read it sooner.
### So Good they can’t ignore you by Cal Newport.
### Discover Your Inner Economist by Tyler Cowen
###  Way Of The Peaceful Warrior by Dan Millman.
###  Awaken The Giant Within By Tony Robbins
### Money by Tony Robbins
### The elements of computing systems
### Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand
### The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand
### 20,000 leagues under the sea
### Algorithms Unlocked
### Computer organization and design
### Chronicles of Narnia
### Harry Potter series
Duh.
### Not Caring What People Think Is A Superpower by Ed Latimore
### A Mind At Play 
### Play It Away Charlie Hoehn.
A cure or alleviation to anxiety and stress is play. There are various forms of play and the book goes into discovering what kind of play works for you. For me after reading this book, I started making more time for board games, frisbee and other forms of play I love. 
### The art of learning
### Lord of the Rings series
### The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up
### On Writing Well
The best book I've ever read on writing. Much of this book could apply to not just writing but coding or living. 
### The Enchanted Forest Chronices
### The Dolphins of Oceanus by John Hoopes.
### You don’t know JS series 
### The Princessa: Machiavelli for Women by  Harriet Rubin.
### Rules of Titans Tim Ferris
### Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja
### Dune
### Vanity Fair by William Makepeace Thackeray.
Learn from Becky Sharp so you can make sure you never become like her. The movie of this with Reese Witherspoon was quite good (albeit depressing) too.
### Alice In Wonderland
### 12 rules for life by Jordan B. Peterson
### The Last Unicorn
### Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte.
### Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte.
### His Dark Materials series
### The Great Gatsby
### Little Women 
### Pro React 16
### Excuse Me Your Life Is Waiting by Lynn Grabhorn. 
I remember taking this from my mom's bookshelf when I was around 13 or 14. This book changed my life because it introduced to me for the first time the idea that you can change your thoughts.
###  [The history of US series.](https://www.amazon.com/History-US-Eleven-Set-Paperback/dp/0195327276)
