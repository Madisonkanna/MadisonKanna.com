I'm currently taking freeCodeCamp's [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) certification for the first time and recording myself code as I go through each part of the curriciulum. I decided to do this as a fun refresher and to strenghten my core JS skills. I've never completed this curriciulum before, and there are several parts I'm excited for - in particular, the section on understanding regular expressions.

If you'd like to join me in completing this certification, [sign up to my code club](https://madisonkanna.us14.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=323fd92759e9e0b8d4083d008&id=033dfeb98f), and once you're in our discord, joint he #freecodecamp-curriciulum channel. Here you can post when you get stuck, or discuss the challenge with me as you go. 

My goal is to upload a new video each week and finish the certification in 10 weeks.
