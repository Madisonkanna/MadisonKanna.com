##  Why Nerds Are Unpopular <a name="why-nerds"></a>

The purpose of school is to keep kids locked up in one place all day so adults can get things done. Two problems with this: 1) kids aren’t told about this, and 2) just like how inmates run prisons, schools are run by the students. These students are trapped in a bubble where nothing they do has more than a local effect. Most schools have no real purpose, but groups create hierarchies. Without meaningful criteria to determine ranking, the situation degenerates into a popularity contest. 

Smart kids aren’t popular because they want to be smart more than they want to be popular. Popularity is a goal that requires full time focus to succeed at, and nerds tend to be more focused on the goal of being smart. Few smart kids can spare the attention popularity requires. 

In any social hierarchy, people unsure of their position will try to emphasize it by bullying people who they think rank below them. Because nerds are usually unpopular, they’re also often bullied. 

Nerds tend to be a step ahead of other kids, as the nerds are wondering about the real world (what matters in it) instead of playing the popularity game. 

When trying to account for why teenagers are unhappy and treat each other badly, we tend to blame hormones. We say that all kids are miserable at that age, even though this wasn’t considered to be a universal fact until the twentieth century. Yet teenagers are unhappy because they’re cooped up together for years with nothing real to do.
