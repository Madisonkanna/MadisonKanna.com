## The Closing Of The Frontier <a name="closing-frontier"></a>

In Western nations it’s a cultural assumption that unexplored frontiers to conquer are not just desirable but the very point of life. But now for the first time since 1491, we’ve found technology too limited and the distance too far to take us somewhere new and undiscovered. We used to believe we’d have reusable spacecraft, and human missions to mars within the decade of the moon landing. These dreams lost most adherents in the 170s when we decided that what’s up there is out of reach. This is a resignation that haunts our present civilization.  

We have no frontier, although our ebb of optimism and loss of faith in institutions still may have happened if we had one. The frontier closed and since Apollo, we have entered into decadence.

### Definition of decadence. 
Decadence refers to economic stagnation, institutional decay, and cultural and intellectual exhaustion at a high level of material prosperity and technological development. Repetition is more normal than innovation. Crucially, the stagnation and decay is often a direct consequence of previous development. The decadent society is by definition, a victim of its own success. This definition applies to the contemporary West over the last 2 generations and may apply to all societies. 

“There was nothing left that could conquer Rome, but there was also nothing left that could improve it... It was the end of the world, and the worst of it was that it never need end.” This dilemma is now not Rome’s but ours.

## The Four Horsemen <a name="horsemen"></a>

### Stagnation <a name="stagnation"></a>

The last 50 years of developed world economic history, we see an era of deceleration followed by stagnation. 

**Limits of neoliberalism**. In response to post-JFK economic disappointments, policy makers of both political parties embraced the policy mix that now gets labeled ‘neoliberalism’: lower taxes and deregulation, free trade and anti-inflationary  monetary policy. This was in response to the stagflation (prices rise while the economy is stagnant) of the 1970s. The post politically appealing theories (currently animating our populist and socialist insurgencies) tend to blame neoliberalism itself. We’re seeing not the outright failure of neoliberalism but diminishing returns from some of its preferred policies, and an overconfidence among the Western leadership class that solutions from 1970s are permanently applicable. 

**Limits on growth.** We’re in an age of econom limits, with 5 major structural forces that make a return to pre-1970s growth rates unlikely: 

1. **Weight of the demographics.** Collapse in Western and East Asian birth rates, aging of rich societies. Welfare becomes more expensive, future GDP growth limited, and the culture of the developed world is complacent. 

2. **Overhang of debt.** Deficits are long-term constraints. 

3. **Constraints on education.** We went from 6 percent to 70 percent high school graduation rate in 3 generations, but that can only happen once. 

4. **Constraints imposed by the environment.** Growth America had in the 18th and 19th century by taming a wilderness and putting fallow land to use will never be repeated. All growth henceforth is contraised by the need to adapt to climate change--a change that represents a “payback” for growth from the industrial revolution. Even if these costs are mitigated by renewable-energy innovations that make fossil-fuel regulations and carbon taxes unnecessary, innovations involved will be on the defense. 

5. **Technological stagnation.** The concept of the ‘technological sublime’ refers to shared cultural moments in which some feat of technical mastery elicits the same kind of spiritualized reaction as the glory of France's Chartres Cathedral. Examples from the past: the steamship, the railroad, the moon landing. We’ve had nothing like this since the moon landing. Closest we’ve had to one of these moments was the iPhone creation. Inventions we expected 50 years ago are now dismissed as fantasies. “We were promised flying cars, got 140 characters.”

Americans no longer move as much, switch jobs less, invest less, have less babies, build fewer companies, freelance less. There are real breakthroughs happening but their gee-whiz spirit is consistently at odds with the general deceleration pattern of the last few generations. Some argue our decline in innovation proves we are reaching some inherent limit on possible innovation, but there’s also evidence that a period of stagnation like ours could lead to a sudden age of discovery.
